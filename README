Side mount for BigTreeTech 5" display

I reused the screen enclosure from:
 
    https://www.printables.com/model/840148-vzbot-235-btt-hdmi-5-screen-mount
    
and modified the base from Jan VZ.175's mod from vzbot discord:

	https://discord.com/channels/829828765512106054/1270327136934428672

and created the side mount. I made this wide to be printed without supports
side wise for extra strength.
